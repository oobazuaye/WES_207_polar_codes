# WES_207_polar_codes
polar codes implementations for WES 207 capstone

polar_codes_software/ contains my C and Python libraries/implementations of polar encoders and decoders
   - the python library includes code for monte carlo frozen bit selection, and a function for drawing the XOR lattice in encoders
   
polar_codes_hdl/ contains my SystemVerilog and VHDL implementations of the polar encoder and SC decoder, respectively

polar_codes_hls/ contains my HLS implementation of an encoder and SC decoder for a 32-bit long code
